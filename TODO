Version 0.0.1
First stage
Todo:
  ✔ Create Basic template Code and Data structures
  ☐ Design basic physics and world Data Structures
  ☐ Create Menu rendering (or use library, experiment)
  ☐ Document (look into automatic documentation)
  Documentation:
    ✔ Refactor and comment everything
    ☐ Look into Doxygen
    ☐ If Doxygen is suitable, change comments to fit Doxygen
  Coding:
    ☐ Make a shading program that renders multiple meshes at a time (Jeremy Hart knows how to do this, check with him)
  Debuging:
    ☐ Figure out howblender maps the texture coordinates and get it to work (cube looks odd)
